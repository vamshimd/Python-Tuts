1. Interpreted:
    An Interpreted language executes its statements line by line.
    Languages such as Python, Javascript, R, PHP, and Ruby are prime examples of Interpreted languages.
    Programs written in an interpreted language runs directly from the source code, with no intermediary compilation step.

    Python directly runs the program from source code
    
2.High-level:
    In Python, no need to take care about low-level details such as managing the memory used by the program.

3.Free and Open Source:
    it is free for any purpose either personal or professional, open source - source code is available for anyone, we can see, share and modify the source code

4. Platform Independent:
    Python programs can be developed and executed on multiple operating system platforms.
    Python can be used on Linux, Windows, Macintosh, Solaris and many more.

5. Simple syntax:
    Closer to English language;Easy to Learn
    More emphasis on the solution to the problem rather than the syntax
6. Embeddable:
    Python can be used within C/C++ program to give scripting capabilities for the program’s users.

7. Robust:
    Exceptional handling features
    Memory management techniques in built

8. Rich Library Support:
    The Python Standard Library is very vast.
    Known as the “batteries included” philosophy of Python ;It can help do various things involving regular expressions, documentation generation, unit testing, threading, databases, web browsers, CGI, email, XML, HTML, WAV files, cryptography, GUI and many more.
    Besides the standard library, there are various other high-quality libraries such as the Python Imaging Library which is an amazingly simple image manipulation library.
    numpy for numerical calculations, pandas for data analytics
